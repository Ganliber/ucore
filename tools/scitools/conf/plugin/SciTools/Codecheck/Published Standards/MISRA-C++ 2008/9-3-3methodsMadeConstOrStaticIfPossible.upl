<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
Declaring a member function static or const limits its access to the non-static data members.
This helps to prevent unintentional modification of the data, and facilitates compliance with
Rule 7–1–1.</p>
<br>

<b>Example</b><pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">

  class A
  {
  public:
    int16_t f1 ( )    // Non-compliant – can be const
    {
      return m_i;
    }
    int16_t f2 ( )    // Non-compliant – can be static
    {
      return m_s;
    }
    int16_t f3 ( )    // Compliant – cannot be const or static
    {
      return ++m_i;
    }
  private:
    int16_t m_i;
    static int16_t m_s;
  };
