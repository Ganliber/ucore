<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
The storage layout used for floating-point values may vary from one compiler to another, and
therefore no floating-point manipulations shall be made which rely directly on the way the values
are stored. The in-built operators and functions, which hide the storage details from the developer,
should be used.</p>
<br>
<b>Example</b><pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">
  float My_fabs ( float f )
  {
    unsigned char * pB = reinterpret_cast< unsigned char * >( &f );
    *( pB + 3 ) &= 0x7f; // Non-compliant â€“ generate the absolute value
                         // of an IEEE-754 float value.
    return ( f );
  }
</pre>
<p><b>Developer's Note</b><br>
There are three ways to directly modify the bit field in a float. First is using a C type cast. This
check catches that usage. The next is by using a Union and combining a float with another data type 
under one identifier. By modifying the non-float data type, the programmer is violating the above rule. 
This check accurately detects when a float is modified through a union.<BR>
<BR>
The last way is to use a reinterpret_cast call as demonstrated above. Because of the modularity of the
C++ language, it is currently impossible to detect when a bit field of a float is modified through the
use of a reinterpret_cast for all cases. This check instead detects when reinterpret_cast is used on a
float and then flags that usage as an error. This can create false positives as simply examining the 
data after using reinterpret_cast does not violate this rule.</p>
