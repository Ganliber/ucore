#This script is designed to run with Understand - CodeCheck
# Written by Kyle Jackson

# Boiler Plate code
use base ("Understand::Codecheck");
use strict;

# This is the error that will be returned when a violation is found
use constant ERR1 => 'Function identifier %1 used incorrectly';

# This registers ERR1 with Understand
sub register_tr_text() {
  my $check = shift;
  $check->add_tr_text(ERR1);
}

# This is the short error the Understand will use
sub name { return "16.9 A function identifier shall only be used with either a preceding &, or with a parenthesised parameter list, which may be empty";}

# This is the full description of the rule being tested
sub description { return "16.9 (Required) A function identifier shall only be used with either a preceding &, or with a parenthesised parameter list, which may be empty.";}

# This section returns the rational and examples to be given to the user through Understand
sub detailed_description { return <<"END_DESC"

<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
If the programmer writes:</p>
<br>

<b>Example</b><pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">

  if (f) /* not compliant - gives a constant non-zero value which is
            the address of f - use either f() or &f */
  {
    /* ... */
  }

</pre>

<br>
<p>
then it is not clear if the intent is to test if the address of the function is not <i>NULL</i> or that a call to
the function f() should be made.</p>
