This is open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.  See the COPYING.LIB file for details.
Some included utilities are distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, a copy of which is included in the file COPYING.

INSTALLING

Copy the gnu.regexp jar file (located in the 'lib' directory)
to your usual installation directory for Java archives.

To use gnu.regexp, you will need to include it in your classpath
setting.  Typically this is done by adding an entry to your CLASSPATH
variable setting with the full path to the JAR file, e.g.
  csh:  % setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:/usr/java/lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.x.jar
 bash:  % export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:/usr/java/lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.x.jar
  DOS:  > set CLASSPATH %CLASSPATH%;C:\Java\lib\gnu-regexp-1.1.x.jar
Various shells and operating systems may have slightly different methods.
Consult your Java virtual machine documentation for details.  You may also
specify the -classpath option to the java executable, e.g.
compile: % javac -classpath /usr/java/lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.x.jar MyClass.java
execute: % java -classpath /usr/java/lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.x.jar MyClass

DOCUMENTATION

HTML documentation is provided in the 'docs' directory.  This is basically
a snapshot of the official gnu.regexp web site (see below for URL).  The
documentation files are:
 docs/index.html -- general package information
 docs/changes.html -- change history
 docs/credits.html -- credits and contributors
 docs/faq.html -- frequently asked questions
 docs/syntax.html -- supported/unsupported syntax and usage notes
 docs/reapplet.html -- demo applet HTML wrapper
 docs/api/*.html -- javadoc generated info

For additional help, you can try emailing <help-java-regexp@gnu.org>.

UTILITIES

gnu.regexp comes with a number of simple utility programs intended to test
and demonstrate its features.  These are not compiled into the Java archive
file, but can be found in the 'src/gnu/regexp/util' directory.  To run the
Grep and Egrep programs, you'll need to install the gnu.getopt package,
available at http://www.urbanophile.com/~arenn/hacking/download.html, and put
those class files in your classpath as well.  

HACKING

You are free to fold, spindle, mutilate and modify this library,
provided you follow the terms outlined in COPYING.LIB.  The gnu.regexp
project team gratefully accepts any bug fixes or enhancements you may
come up with (see the TODO file if you're in need of some ideas). A
few parameters at the top of the Makefile in the 'src' directory
need to be edited to match your local system setup.

BUG REPORTS

Send bug reports to <bug-java-regexp@gnu.org>, or join the gnu.regexp
mailing list by sending a "subscribe" message to
<regexp-request@cacas.org>.  It helps if you can send a code sample
showing the regular expression you were using and how you were using
it.

LATEST VERSION

You can always obtain info about the latest version of gnu.regexp at
http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/.  New versions are also announced on
the regexp mailing list (see above).

Thanks!
